                <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational
                    security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we

                    electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be
                    guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers,
                    cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our
                    security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although
                    we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal
                    information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the
                    Services within a secure environment.
